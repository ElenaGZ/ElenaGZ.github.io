  <h1>ZORA</h1>
  <h2>More than food</h2>
  <p>To break your own rules and overcome inertia is not easy, but sometimes it's the only way to reach true success.<br>
  At Zora, true luxury lies in closeness, in the small things, exempt from restraints and clich√©s. It lies in the art of hosting and the act of expressing.</p>
